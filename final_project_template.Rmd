Use this template to complete your project throughout the course. Your Final Project presentation will be based on the contents of this document. Replace the title/name above and text below with your own, but keep the headers.

### Overview
Give a brief a description of your project and its goal(s), what data you are using to complete it, and what three faculty/staff in different fields you have spoken to about your project with a brief summary of what you learned from each person. Include a link to your final project GitHub repository.


### Introduction 
Describe the problem addressed, its significance, and some background to motivate the problem.

Explain why your problem is interdisciplinary, what fields can contribute to its understanding, and incorporate background related to what you learned from meeting with faculty/staff.

Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death, and despite improvements in diagnosis, the death rate remains high. LUAD accounts for more than 40% of all lung cancer cases. Therefore, the treatment of LUAD is of great significance for improving the treatment quality of lung cancer patients. Natural genetic variation in the human genome is one reason for differences in individual responses to drugs. However, little research has been done on genetic differences between cancer patients. Although traditional therapies have been improved to varying degrees through the use of molecular drugs, individual patient differences lead to different target specificity. Therefore, in order to benefit patients, it is necessary to continue research on known targets or to find new targets associated with LUAD. In this study, we used RStudio to obtain correlation values and connectivity between differentially expressed genes. It is expected that TCGA LUAD samples will be divided into different immune infiltrating subtypes and associated gene modules and hub genes will be screened by weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). It is expected that the key genes related to immune infiltration can be screened out by differential expression analysis and other methods to construct their PPI network. The correlation analysis of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the screening of GPCR ligands have always been the focus of new drug development. In recent years, new studies have demonstrated the existence of newly discovered intracellular and extracellular interactions of GPCRs. Therefore, whether LUAD has unstudied GPCR related targets may be a novel direction. In similar studies, accurate identification of target-drug interactions is one of the key steps in the design of targeted drugs. However, screening drugs on an experimental scale is very expensive. Therefore, it is important to predict the interaction between substrate and drug pair directly from molecular sequence.


### Methods
Describe the data used and general methodological approach. Subsequently, incorporate full R code necessary to retrieve and clean data, and perform analysis. Be sure to include a description of code so that others (including your future self) can understand what you are doing and why.
